/*
Concurrency Exercise 2
        - Make a "Person" class having a name, id, address and phone number.
        - Make a class holding a list of persons that can search by any of the previous attributes.
        - It must be designed to search quickly even with a very big number of persons, so use Maps efficiently.
        - To accomplish this goal you will need a separate Map for each attribute, and different Maps may be of different types, though they must point to the same Person objects.
        - Methods that insert or delete a person must not expose their partial results (i.e. the new Person must not be searchable by any Map until it has been inserted in all Maps).
        - Tip: using synchronized blocks should be enough.
        - Create a new Client Thread that should randomly add new   persons after a given timeout
        - Create a new Client Thread that should randomly search for attributes after a given timeout
        - Create a new Client Thread that should randomly delete persons after a given timeout
        - In the main class we should start 2 of each client and see how the application is behaved.
